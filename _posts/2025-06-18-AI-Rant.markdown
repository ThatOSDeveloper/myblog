I use gentoo for a reason now.

I never really understood why AI is the big thing until recently, it makes a lot of money because it pleases the stockholders which is why valve/steam and other private companies do not do all of the AI stuff.

## What I dislike about AI

AI itself is interesting, and can do cool things like play doom. The thing I dislike about AI, is how its used by companies, its forced upon us, being an end user from a company like microsoft and using modern Windows (I use gentoo now) means you are forced to use copilot. The final thing that I dislike about AI is when its put into things that its not needed to be in, for example a toaster, its not needed, AI is not needed for a toaster.

### What is forced AI?

Forced AI is in my option AI that is enabled by default, and is usually hard to disable but being hard to disable is **NOT** a requirement.
